  title: Landsat Fractional Cover Percentiles
  description: Landsat Fractional Cover percentile 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577) 
  summary: >
      The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing
      Research Program and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has
      been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat
      Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational
      Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface
      reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0).

      FC provides fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or
      photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover
      across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple
      linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained
      non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see
      the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read:

      'Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland',
      Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry Conference

      A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available
      from the AusCover website: http://www.auscover.org.au/purl/landsat-fractional-cover-jrsrp

      Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform
      evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk,
      soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information
      could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and
      scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.

  acknowledgment: |
    - Landsat data is provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) through direct reception of the data at Geoscience Australias satellite reception facility or download.
    - The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture & ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent.
    - FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments.
